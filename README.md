# Qwixx-Simulation

## Project Description
Qwixx Dice Game is a board game that is based on dice rolls and strategic decision-making. This project aims to determine the most effective strategy for maximizing a player's chances of winning while examining the probabilistic nature of outcomes and overall strategy effectiveness. By using Monte Carlo simulations to estimate expected scores, game length distributions, and the impact of different player strategies, we identified the optimal approach for Qwixx and assessed the role that randomness plays in determining success.
